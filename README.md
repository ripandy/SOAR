# Scriptable Object Architecture Reactive-extensible

<!-- [![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.kadinche.kassets?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.kadinche.kassets/) -->

SOAR is an implementation of [Scriptable Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html) Architecture.
Scriptable Object Architecture intends to provide clean and decoupled code architecture.
SOAR is implemented based on [Ryan Hipple's talk at Unite Austin 2017](https://youtu.be/raQ3iHhE_Kk).

SOAR is developed and designed to be extensible with Reactive library R3.
R3 is a feature rich and modern Reactive Extensions for C#.
SOAR tries to wraps and utilize R3's feature within the Scriptable Object Architecture.
SOAR can function independently, but its implementation is bare minimum.
It is highly recommended to use SOAR in conjunction with R3.

- [R3] - The new future of dotnet/reactive and UniRx.
- [Kassets] - SOAR's predecessor. Scriptable Object Architecture extensible with UniRx and UniTask.

### Unity Version
- Unity 2022.3+
